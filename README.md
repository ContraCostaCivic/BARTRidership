# BARTRidership

## Objective
Analyze and/or visualize BART ridership data posted on its web site. News reports indicate that ridership is down (see for example https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/With-BART-ridership-down-and-complaints-up-12585051.php). Can the data help us explain this phenomenon? For example, are some riders switching to Uber/Lyft for certain types of trips?
